# Drude-Lorentz
Drude-lorentz model simulation

This program allows you to plot the following dependencies using the Drude-lorentz model:
1) the real part of the permittivity ε'(ν);
2) the imaginary part of the permittivity ε''(ν);
3) the real part of the refractive index n(ν);
4) the imaginary part of the refractive index k(ν);
5) intensity reflection coefficient R 12 (ν) (this is for the analysis of reflection from the semi-
infinite environment);
6) the phase of the reflection coefficient in amplitude;
7) absorption coefficient (in reciprocal centimeters);
8) optical density of the film (excluding interference) D(ν).
9) film transmission T(ν);
10) optical density of the film (taking into account interference) A(ν).
11) exported experimental spectrum.

Additional charts:
1) intensity reflection coefficient for TE-wave (s-wave) RTE 12 (ν) (for
analysis of reflection from a semi-infinite medium);
2) intensity reflection coefficient for TM-wave (p-wave) RTM 12 (v) (for
analysis of reflection from a semi-infinite medium);
3) the phase of the reflection coefficient in amplitude for the TE-wave (s-wave);
4) the phase of the reflection coefficient in amplitude for the TM-wave (p-wave);
5) reflection coefficient by the intensity of the unpolarized wave
